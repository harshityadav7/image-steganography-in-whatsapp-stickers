# image-steganography-in-whatsapp-stickers
The project aims to develop a system for image steganography within WhatsApp stickers. Steganography is the art of concealing data within another file, in this case, hiding information within sticker images. This project's primary goal is to create a secure and user-friendly tool that allows users to hide text or small images within sticker images that can be shared via WhatsApp.
